# BetterNetherBeta Mod

**for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3**

generator. It is a not direct port of original BetterNether mod or Minecraft 1.16 biomes
into beta, but it can have similar vibes.

and **[Station API 2.0](https://jenkins.glass-launcher.net/job/StationAPI/513/artifact/build/libs/StationAPI-be5f057.jar)**
